This project utilizes Graphs & a Graph Algorithm --> DFS

Given 2 input files that hold content of:
  - Flight Data, delimited by '|'
  - Flight Request, delimited by '|'

The code will:
  - Parse the input
  - Store the data
  - Create a Graph
  - Perform DFS (Depth First Search)
  - Find all possible routes from start --> dest
  - Return the top 3 shortest routes, based on if the request was cost or time
  - The output is printed onto the screen as well as outputted to an outfile
